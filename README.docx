This project is an AI-powered, fully offline Python code explainer aimed at simplifying programming education and improving code comprehension for beginners.
Using HuggingFace’s GPT-Neo 125M, the tool interprets Python scripts and generates beginner-friendly, human-readable explanations — all without requiring any internet connection.
Designed with Streamlit for an interactive frontend and PyTorch for efficient model handling, the application delivers a clean, easy-to-use interface that operates entirely on local CPU hardware.
It’s a privacy-first solution, ideal for classrooms, coding bootcamps, or self-learners who want to understand what their code does — line by line — in real time.
The tool supports a variety of Python constructs such as loops, functions, and conditional statements, and handles both straightforward and moderately complex logic.
With no external API calls, users benefit from enhanced portability, speed, and complete control over their data.
Whether you're a student debugging assignments or a teacher demonstrating concepts offline, this application serves as a lightweight, educational code companion powered by the capabilities of open-source large language models.
